SetWorkFocus
=====

This is just a simple thing to let you run the command "setworkfocus" from
anywhere. It will then take your current working directory and smash it into
your bash profile, so that next time you open a shell it drops you into your
"workfocus" directory. If you are like me you spend time deep in Git/SVN checkouts
or on weird file share paths that SUUUUCK to type in all the time....this fixes that.
