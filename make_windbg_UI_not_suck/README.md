Make Windbg Look Better
=====

So everyone likes the way OllyDBG looks. But basically every other debugger
pales in comparison to the power of WinDBG (sorry Immunity ;-). So this is
a Windbg workspace file that will make WinDBG look A LOT better. Green Text, black background,
and a VERY useful window arrangement.
