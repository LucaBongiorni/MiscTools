Serial Snoop
=====

Using two serial ports, this software acts an inline proxy allowing
you to sniff and edits the data as it passes between the ports.
It actually is an annoying problem to solve multiplexing the IO,
but the notes about how it works and how it's done are all in the source.

Very useful for sniffing how a device might talk to a peripheral...
