<h2>Byte Order Mark FAQ (from www.unicode.org)</h2>
        
<p>Q: What is a BOM?</p>   
<p>A: A <i>byte order mark </i>(BOM) consists of the character 
code U+FEFF at the beginning of a data stream, where it can be used  
as a signature defining the byte order and encoding form, primarily of
unmarked plaintext files. Under some higher level protocols, use of
a BOM may be mandatory 
(or prohibited) in the Unicode data stream defined in that protocol. 
</p>

<p>Q: Where is a BOM useful?</p>   
<p>A: A BOM is useful at the beginning of files that are typed as   
text, but for which it is not known whether they are in big or little endian format-it 
can also serve as a hint indicating that the file is in Unicode, as 
opposed to in a legacy encoding and furthermore, it act as a signature 
for the specific encoding form used .
</p>
  
<p>Q: What does &#8216;endian&#8217; mean?</p>  
<p>A: Data types longer than a byte can be stored in computer 
memory with the most significant byte (MSB) first or last. The former is 
called big-endian, the latter little-endian. When data are exchange in 
the same byte order as they were in the memory of the originating 
system, they may appear to be in the wrong byte order on the receiving 
system. In that situation, a BOM would look like 0xFFFE which is a 
noncharacter, allowing the receiving system to apply byte reversal 
before processing the data. UTF-8 is byte oriented and therefore does 
not have that issue. Nevertheless, an initial BOM might be useful to 
identify the datastream as UTF-8.
</p> 
<p>Q: When a BOM is used, is it only in 16-bit Unicode text?</p>   
<p>A: No, a BOM can be used as a signature no matter how the 
Unicode text is transformed: UTF-16, UTF-8, UTF-7, etc. The exact bytes 
comprising the BOM will be whatever the Unicode character FEFF is 
converted into by that transformation format. In that form, the BOM 
serves to indicate both that it is a Unicode file, and which of the 
formats it is in. Examples:</p>

<p>Q: Can a UTF-8 data stream contain the BOM    
character (in UTF-8 form)? If yes, then can I still assume the remaining    
UTF-8 bytes are in big-endian order?</p>   
<p>A: Yes, UTF-8 can contain a BOM. However, it makes <i>no</i>  
difference as to the endianness of the byte stream. UTF-8 always has the  
same byte order. An initial BOM is <i>only</i> used as a signature &#8212; an  
indication that an otherwise unmarked text file is in UTF-8. Note that 
some recipients of UTF-8 encoded data do not expect a BOM. Where UTF-8 
is used<i> transparently</i> in 8-bit environments, the use of a BOM 
will interfere with any protocol or file format that expects specific 
ASCII characters at the beginning, such as the use of "#!" of at the 
beginning of Unix shell scripts.

</p><p>Q: What should I do with U+FEFF in the middle of a file?</p>   
<p>A: In the absence of a protocol supporting its use as a BOM and when not at the   
beginning of a text stream, U+FEFF should normally not occur. For 
backwards compatibility it should be treated as ZERO WIDTH  
NON-BREAKING SPACE (ZWNBSP),   
and is then part of the content of the file or string. The use of  
U+2060 WORD JOINER is strongly preferred over ZWNBSP for expressing word joining 
semantics since it cannot be confused with a BOM. When designing a markup 
language or data protocol, the use of U+FEFF can be restricted to that 
of Byte Order Mark. In that case, any U+FEFF occurring in the middle of 
the file can be ignored, or treated as an error. 
</p>

<p>Q: I am using a protocol that has BOM at    
the start of text. How do I represent an initial ZWNBSP?</p>   
<p>A: Use U+2060 WORD JOINER instead.</p>  

<p>Q: How do I tag data that does not interpret FEFF as a BOM?</p>   
<p>A: Use the tag <tt>UTF-16BE</tt> to indicate big-endian  
UTF-16 text, and <tt>UTF-16LE</tt> to indicate little-endian UTF-16  
text. If you do use a BOM, tag the text as simply <tt>UTF-16</tt>. 
</p>

<p>Q: Why wouldn&#8217;t I always use a protocol that requires a BOM?</p>   
<p>A: Where the data is typed, such as a field in a database,  
a BOM is unnecessary. In particular, if a text data stream is marked as  
UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE or UTF-32LE, a BOM is neither necessary nor <i>permitted</i>. 
Any FEFF would be interpreted as a ZWNBSP.</p>
<p>Do not tag every string in a database or set of fields with a BOM, 
since it wastes space and complicates string concatenation. Moreover, it also means two data fields may have  
precisely the same content, but not be binary-equal (where one is  
prefaced by a BOM).</p> 
<p>Q: How I should deal with BOMs?</p>   
<p>A: Here are some guidelines to follow: </p>
<ol>
          <li>
          <p class="a">A particular protocol (e.g. Microsoft conventions for 
          .txt files) may require use of the BOM on certain Unicode data 
          streams, such as files. When you need to conform to such a protocol, 
          use a BOM. 
          </p></li><li>
          <p class="a">Some protocols allow optional BOMs in the case of 
          untagged text. In those cases,
          </p><ul>
            <li>
            <p class="a">Where a text data stream is known to be plain text, but 
            of unknown encoding, BOM can be used as a signature. If there is no 
            BOM, the encoding could be anything.
            </p></li><li>

            <p class="a">Where a text data stream is known to be plain Unicode 
            text (but not which endian), then BOM can be used as a signature. If 
            there is no BOM, the text should be interpreted as big-endian.
          </p></li></ul>
          </li>
          <li>
		<p class="a">Some byte oriented protocols expect ASCII characters at 
		the beginning of a file. If UTF-8 is used with these protocols, use 
		of the BOM as encoding form signature should be avoided.
          </p></li><li>
        <p class="a">Where the precise type of the data stream is known (e.g.  
        Unicode big-endian or Unicode little-endian), the BOM should not be  
        used. In particular, whenever a data stream is declared to be 
	UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE or UTF-32LE a BOM <i>must</i> not be 
	used.
