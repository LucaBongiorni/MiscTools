Window Registry Ruby Code
=====

Just run registry.rb from a Windows Machine with Ruby installed.
The Cli should be self explanatory. It basically walks the entire
windows registry.

Regenum was written by Eric Monti (then at Matasano) but then I
modified is slightly and gave it a simple UI so that you can interactively
walk the windows registry from within a simple UI and make modifications.
